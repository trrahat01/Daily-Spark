## Advertising

Daily Spark is free and supported by Google AdMob ads.

- Implementation uses frequency capping so ads never interrupt your experience.
- AdMob test ads are used during development.
- Users can disable personalized ads via Google's ad settings at any time.

## Privacy Policy Requirement

Google Play requires a privacy policy. A ready-to-publish policy is included in:

`PRIVACY_POLICY.md`

Publish that policy at a public URL (Google Sites / GitHub Pages / Notion), then add
the URL in `Play Console -> App content -> Privacy policy`.

## Data Safety Form Guidance

- Data collected: `No user personal data collected for normal quote browsing`
- Data shared: `No`
- Data encrypted in transit: `Yes`
- Account creation: `No`
- Data deletion request: `Not applicable` (no end-user accounts)
- Ads: `Yes — Google AdMob` (declare ads in the Data Safety form)
- Location / Camera / Microphone / Photos: `No`

Because AdMob is now integrated, be sure to:
1. Declare ads in the Google Play Data Safety form.
2. Add the "Shares data with advertisers for advertising" disclosures that AdMob requires.
