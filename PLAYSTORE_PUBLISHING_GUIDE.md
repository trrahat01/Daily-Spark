## 0. Prerequisites

1. **Google Play Developer account** — a **one-time $25 fee** (required; no way around it).
   - Go to <https://play.google.com/console> → Sign in with a Google account
   - Complete payment + the developer verification form (name, address, etc.)
2. **Expo/EAS account** — already set up (`trrahat`); used to build the signed AAB.
3. **AdMob account** — optional but recommended; link your app and get a real App ID.
4. **Privacy policy URL** (READY) — `https://trrahat01.github.io/daily-spark-privacy/`
5. **Store assets** — app icon, feature graphic, screenshots (specs below).

---

## Step 1 — Generate the store-listing assets

Create these files (PNG/JPG):

| Asset | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| App icon | `512 x 512` | Your logo, no transparency bleed |
| Feature graphic | `1024 x 500` | Banner used at the top of the store page |
| Phone screenshots | at least 2 (5–8 recommended) | Sized to your device, e.g. `1080 x 2400` |

> ℹ️ When you give me your logo/images, I will generate these published assets for you.

---

## Step 2 — Build the release AAB (signed)

From the project folder, in PowerShell:

```powershell
cd D:\React Native\Daily-Spark
$env:EXPO_PUBLIC_APP_VARIANT="user"
npx eas login                     # sign in as trrahat
npx eas build -p android --profile production-user --clear-cache
```

- EAS signs the package automatically (keep the remote keystore safe).
- When done it prints a **BUILD_ID** and a link. The output is an **.aab** file (required by Play).
- Each next release must bump `android.versionCode` in `app.json`.

---

## Step 3 — Create the app in Play Console

1. Open <https://play.google.com/console> → **Create app**.
2. Choose: Language **English (United States)**, App name `Daily Spark – Motivational Quotes & Daily Inspiration`, type **App**, **Free**, and **Yes, it contains ads**.
3. Click **Create app**.

> 🖼️ **Ready store assets** are generated in the project at `assets/publish/`:
> - `icon-512.png` (512×512 app icon)
> - `feature-1024x500.png` (1024×500 feature graphic)
> - `screenshot-1..5.jpg` (720×1650 phone screenshots)
> Upload these directly in **Store presence → Main store listing**.

---

```

Upload: **App icon**, **Feature graphic**, **Phone screenshots**.

## Step 5 — Privacy policy

**App content → Privacy policy**
- Select **Privacy policy URL** and enter:
```
https://trrahat01.github.io/daily-spark-privacy/
```
- Review and mark it **Approved**.

---

## Step 6 — Data safety form

**App content → Data safety** (matches the current app):

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Does your app collect or share user data? | **No** (no login, no user accounts) |
| Data collected | **None** for core functionality |
| Declared features | **Advertising or marketing** → Yes (AdMob) |
| Data shared | Ads use the Google advertising ID (after consent) |

> If you later add analytics or login, update this form before release.

---

## Step 7 — Ads declaration

**App content → Ads**
- Ads present: **Yes** — accept Google's ads policy.
- Add your **real AdMob App ID** to `app.json` before release:
  ```json
  ["react-native-google-mobile-ads", {
    "androidAppId": "ca-app-pub-YOUR_REAL_ID~XXXXXXXXXX",
    "iosAppId": "ca-app-pub-YOUR_REAL_ID~XXXXXXXXXX"
  }]
  ```
  (The app currently ships with Google's **test** ad IDs — do not go live with them.)

---

## Step 8 — Content rating

**App content → Content rating** — complete the questionnaire (3 steps).
Suggested answers: No realistic violence, No sexual content, No purchase of digital
goods, No user-generated content, No alcohol/tobacco/drugs. Likely rating: **Everyone**.

---

## Step 9 — Target audience & permissions

**App content → Target audience**
- Age range: **18+** (safest with ads), content **All audiences**.
- Ads: **Yes, it shows ads**.

**Permissions** — this app blocks location/camera/mic/media permissions, so declare none.

## Step 10 — Upload the AAB and create a release

**Production (or Testing → Internal testing first) → Create new release**

1. Upload the `.aab` file from Step 2.
2. **Release notes** (What's new):
   ```
   Introducing Daily Spark:
   • Thousands of quotes in multiple languages
   • Quote of the Day, favorites, and share-as-image
   • Language selection, hide quotes, and more
   ```
3. **Save** → **Review release**.

> 🔁 Recommend **Internal testing** first (only your Google account installs it),
> test the live AAB, then promote to Production.

---

## Step 11 — Review, verification, and launch

1. **App content → Policy and programmes → Manage** — review **Ads**, **Permissions**,
   **Data safety**, and **Data deletion**.
2. Accept the **Distribution Agreement**.
3. **Close the loop** / production review: review answers, click "I understand" on
   any red flags, **Save**.
4. Choose **Roll out** on the Production release.
5. The app enters **Review** (usually hours to a couple of days).

---

## Step 12 — Track & maintain

- Watch **Ratings and reviews** after launch.
- For updates: bump `android.versionCode` (1 → 2 → 3 …), rebuild the AAB, upload to the
  same release track.
- Keep the privacy policy and data-safety answers current if features change.

---

## Important reminders

- **Package name is permanent** — `com.dailyspark.quotes`.
- **Bump versionCode** every release or Play rejects the update.
- **Never ship the AdMob test IDs** (`ca-app-pub-3940256099942544…`) live.
- **Keep the keystore safe** — losing it means you can never update the app.
- Screens in Play Console change over time; if a screen differs, use the sidebar
  "App content" sections and follow the same answers.
